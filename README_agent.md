# Agent notes for RobotRumble (gpt-5-5)

Round 1 changes:
- Replaced the starter `robot.py` quadrant targeter. The starter can stalemate forever when mirrored armies start in different quadrants (as in `/logs/rounds/0`, all 200 sims tied 20-20/4-4).
- New strategy: every turn chooses one global focus target using total walking distance, enemy health, and allied adjacency; robots attack adjacent low-health enemies first and otherwise move toward the focus target with simple collision reservations.
- Includes spawn timing avoidance: on turns 10,20,... it avoids moving onto spawn squares because the engine clears spawn tiles at the start of turns 11,21,... before recurring spawns.

Useful local tests run:
```
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test robot.py builtin-bots/simple-bot.js      # Blue/gpt won 137-5
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test builtin-bots/simple-bot.js robot.py      # Red/gpt won 121-15
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test robot.py builtin-bots/heuristic-bot.js   # Blue/gpt won 48-24
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test builtin-bots/heuristic-bot.js robot.py   # Red/gpt won 44-14
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test robot.py builtin-bots/black-magic.js     # lost badly to black-magic (expected; builtin black-magic is very strong)
```
Against the previous checked-in starter (`git show HEAD:robot.py > /tmp/old_robot.py`), current bot wins as both colors on seeds `test` and `0` by large margins.

Potential future work:
- The builtin `black-magic.js` one-ply simulator is stronger than this Python bot; consider porting/adapting its local action scoring to Python if time allows.
- Current movement reservation is greedy in per-unit execution order and cannot coordinate swaps; a global planner in `init_turn` may improve engagements.

Round 2 notes:
- Reviewed `/logs/rounds/1/results.json`: current `robot.py` swept anton__anton3000 250-0 as Blue. Average final state across the 250 sim logs was about Blue 25.7 units / 117.9 HP vs Red 2.1 units / 10 HP.
- I did not change `robot.py`; a small experiment to force adjacent units off spawn on turns 10/20/... did not improve local regression (the previous/current bot beat it head-to-head), so it was reverted.
- Added `tools_analyze_logs.py` to summarize `/logs/rounds/N` text logs for future teammates.
- Current bot still loses badly to builtin `black-magic.js`; a Python port of its one-ply planner was tried in `/tmp` and beat black-magic in one game but was very slow (~20s/sim in Python), so do not drop it in without optimizing heavily.

Round 1 (current) update:
- Replaced `robot.py` again with a faster Python port/adaptation of builtin `black-magic.js` one-ply tactical planner. It precomputes each turn in `init_turn`, predicts adjacent enemy attacks, and greedily improves friendly moves/attacks using lexicographic simulated board score (unit count, surrounds, health, closeness). It keeps the earlier spawn-wipe avoidance for turns 10/20/...
- Saved the previous focus-fire bot as `robot_focus_round1.py` for regression testing/reference.
- Local regression: new `robot.py` beats `robot_focus_round1.py` convincingly as both colors across tested seeds 0,1,2,42 (e.g. seed 42: 17-1 units as Blue and 18-3 as Red). It still beats simple/heuristic/needle/chaser/flail/random builtins as both colors on spot checks.
- Against builtin `black-magic.js` it is much closer than the old focus bot: spot/batch testing was mixed but no longer a blowout (first 10 batch as Blue vs black-magic: 7-3). Runtime is about 1.5-2.8s per local CLI game, well below per-game timeout but slower than old focus bot.

Round 2 follow-up (current agent):
- Reviewed `/logs/rounds/0` and `/logs/rounds/1`: both were 250-0 sweeps for gpt-5-5 against `happysquid__test` (round 0 as Red, round 1 as Blue). The current black-magic-style Python planner leaves the opponent at ~1-2 units on average.
- I kept `robot.py` unchanged after regression tests. It still crushes the saved focus bot (`robot_focus_round1.py`) as both colors on seeds 5-7. Spot checks versus builtin `black-magic.js` remain mixed but competitive.
- Experiments not adopted: a more exact Python movement simulator for the planner (modeled movement priority/blocked chains) regressed vs the current simpler black-magic tick; changing greedy planning order (center/high-adjacency/low-health variants) also regressed or was color-sensitive.
- Recommendation: keep the current bot unless logs show the opponent adapted; if improving, benchmark head-to-head as both colors over multiple seeds because many tactical tweaks are strongly seed/color dependent.

Round 1 review (latest agent):
- Checked `/logs/rounds/0/results.json`: current bot swept `anton__wallifier` 250-0 as Blue, with large average margins (about 28.3 vs 0.9 units, 134 vs 3.4 HP).
- Kept `robot.py` unchanged. The existing black-magic-style tactical planner is already dominating this opponent; earlier notes warn several tactical tweaks regressed in head-to-head tests.
- Spot regression still passes versus builtin heuristic as both colors on seed 0. Recommendation remains: do not change the planner unless new logs show losses or a clear issue.

Round 2 check (latest):
- Re-read current match logs `/logs/rounds/0` and `/logs/rounds/1` against `anton__wallifier`; current `robot.py` swept 250-0 as both Blue and Red. Margins remain huge (round0 avg 28.3 vs 0.9 units, round1 avg 27.7 vs 1.0 units for us).
- Verified `robot.py` still matches the intended fast black-magic-style planner and spot-tested locally versus builtin `black-magic.js`; results are mixed/competitive and runtime is around 2-2.5s per game.
- No bot logic changes made this turn. Given the opponent is being swept and previous tactical changes regressed, safest recommendation is to keep `robot.py` unchanged unless future logs show losses.
