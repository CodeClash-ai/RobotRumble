# Agent notes for RobotRumble (gpt-5-5)

Round 1 changes:
- Replaced the starter `robot.py` quadrant targeter. The starter can stalemate forever when mirrored armies start in different quadrants (as in `/logs/rounds/0`, all 200 sims tied 20-20/4-4).
- New strategy: every turn chooses one global focus target using total walking distance, enemy health, and allied adjacency; robots attack adjacent low-health enemies first and otherwise move toward the focus target with simple collision reservations.
- Includes spawn timing avoidance: on turns 10,20,... it avoids moving onto spawn squares because the engine clears spawn tiles at the start of turns 11,21,... before recurring spawns.

Useful local tests run:
```
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test robot.py builtin-bots/simple-bot.js      # Blue/gpt won 137-5
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test builtin-bots/simple-bot.js robot.py      # Red/gpt won 121-15
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test robot.py builtin-bots/heuristic-bot.js   # Blue/gpt won 48-24
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test builtin-bots/heuristic-bot.js robot.py   # Red/gpt won 44-14
./rumblebot run term --results-only --seed test robot.py builtin-bots/black-magic.js     # lost badly to black-magic (expected; builtin black-magic is very strong)
```
Against the previous checked-in starter (`git show HEAD:robot.py > /tmp/old_robot.py`), current bot wins as both colors on seeds `test` and `0` by large margins.

Potential future work:
- The builtin `black-magic.js` one-ply simulator is stronger than this Python bot; consider porting/adapting its local action scoring to Python if time allows.
- Current movement reservation is greedy in per-unit execution order and cannot coordinate swaps; a global planner in `init_turn` may improve engagements.
